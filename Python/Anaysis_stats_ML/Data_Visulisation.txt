# Good data visulisation includes:
#
# Visual cues, co ordinate systems, scale, contex
#
# Visual encoding
# 
# Posistion, length, angle (hard to differentiate small differences)
# Direction (similar issue to angles)
# Shape (establishing different populations, variable)
# Area (size)
# Colour: Hue (different thigns) Saturation: (value) OR combination (pos neg colours)
#         Never use more than 12 colours  
# Accuracy ranges: from position, angle, area, staturation (highest to lowest)
