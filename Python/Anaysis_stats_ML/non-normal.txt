# Non normal

# Shapiro-Wilk Test
# w,p = scipy.stats.shapio(data)
# w test stat
# p = pval
# is the data from normal distribution 
#
# If large enough sample size can assume normal
#
# Otherwise use Non-parametric tests:
# no assumptions about distribution
#
# Mann-Whitney U test (tests null that 2 pops are the same)
#
# u, p = scipy.stats.manwhitneyu(x,y)
# u = test stat
# p = one side p val
# shows 2 different populations but no other info
